Riley,

You've done a nice job here creating a basic falling-word screensaver.

Your code could use a bit of clearing up -- you have some variable names that are pretty confusing to me (axis? height?). Also, the code that draws the roku is called drawRect -- why? And then you have a function called drawRain that is never called -- again, why?

Given how long you had after you'd gotten the basic "falling Roku" code working, it would have been nice to see some more experimentation to push this project further -- maybe incorporating that "rain" you wrote, or maybe subtly changing things like the speed of the words falling or the colors involved.
